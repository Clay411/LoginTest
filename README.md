Implements several automated login tests to validate logging into Hudl.com.

# Instructions Before Running Tests
A text file containing valid login credentials needs added to your project for the tests to work properly.
Create a file called credentials.txt and place it in the LoginTest project folder.
Example path:  ../LoginTest/credentials.txt

On line 1 of the credentials.txt file, enter a valid Hudl.com user email address.
On line 2 of the credentials.txt file, enter a valid Hudl.com user password.
